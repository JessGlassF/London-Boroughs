    "Part 2: Experiment and Metrics Design\n",
    "1. Key Measure of Success\n",
    "The key measure of success for this experiment would be the increase in the number of trips taken by driver partners between the two cities (Gotham and Metropolis). This metric effectively captures the primary goal of the experiment, which is to encourage driver partners to be available in both cities rather than being exclusive to one city. This would directly reflect the extent to which the toll reimbursement encourages drivers to serve both cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Experiment Design\n",
    "a) Implementation\n",
    "Experiment Group: Offer toll reimbursements to driver partners who travel between the two cities, encouraging them to operate in both areas.\n",
    "Control Group: Maintain the current system without any toll reimbursement.\n",
    "Duration: Run the experiment for at least 3 months to capture seasonal variations and weekend versus weekday travel patterns.\n",
    "Randomization: Randomly select a representative sample of driver partners for each group. Ensure that the sample is stratified by driver activity levels (e.g., high, medium, low activity) to get balanced representation across groups.\n",
    "b) Statistical Test(s)\n",
    "Primary Test: Conduct a two-sample t-test to compare the average number of trips between the experiment and control groups. This will help assess whether there is a statistically significant difference in the number of inter-city trips.\n",
    "Additional Metrics: Track the number of unique drivers switching cities, total toll reimbursements claimed, and average trip earnings per driver.\n",
    "c) Interpretation and Recommendations\n",
    "If the experiment group shows a statistically significant increase in inter-city trips compared to the control group, this would suggest that toll reimbursements are effective in encouraging drivers to operate in both cities.\n",
    "Recommendations: If successful, scale the toll reimbursement program to all driver partners, and monitor for long-term sustainability and impact on driver earnings.\n",
    "Caveats: Consider external factors such as fuel prices, traffic congestion, and seasonal demand fluctuations, which might influence driver behavior. Regularly monitor these factors to adjust the experiment or interpretation as needed.\n",
    "This design approach offers a comprehensive and controlled way to evaluate the effectiveness of the toll reimbursement in achieving the desired outcome."
